My first student project in Yandex.Practikum.
The main goal was to start playing with data, necessary steps before analysis.
The project is about default rates of different groups.
It consists of 3 files:
1. readme
2. credit_scoring_eng.csv - database (provided by Yandex)
3. datapreprocessing.ipynb - Jupiter Notebook with code and results

Python libraries:
pandas
numpy
collections/Counter
nltk
nltk.stem/WordNetLemmatizer
